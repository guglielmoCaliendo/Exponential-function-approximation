      <h1 class="title">Exponential Function Approximation</h1>

      <p>
        Exponential functions are of great importance in mathematics, physics
        and engineering. One of the most important functions is . It has the
        very important property that it is the only function that its derivative
        is the same as itself. So any process where the rate of change of a
        quantity is proportional to the quantity itself will be described by
        exponential functions. Finance, population growth, oscillators all have
        these characteristics. When we want to model these processes in a
        computer we have a problem. is irrational and that means that we have to
        calculate approximate values. Specially our digital computers only know
        how to solve simple operations... so how can we calculate the value of
        complex equations? The answer is to simplify the functions into
        operations a computer can manage without any problem. sums,
        multiplications and divisions are simple enough. Letâ€™s use the following
        formula to estimate the value of e up to 9 decimals only using
        multiplications and sums.

        As you can see is only raised to integer powers (i.e. multiplications)
        and stands for factorial, which is the integer multiplication up to n
        (note that 0! and 1! is equal to 1).

            Build a program that given and would approximate using the identity
            above. That is only using sums, multiplications and divisions
            (exponentials are not allowed by definition). You can use any
            programing language you like (it could be excel if you want).

            up to 9 decimals?
